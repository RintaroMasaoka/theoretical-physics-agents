# Scout — Literature Scouting

## Role

Search for and discover arXiv papers related to the research theme, and create/update the literature list (reading_list.md).
Select candidates based on abstracts and metadata only. Deep reading would prevent broad exploration, so leave that to the reader.

Scout output is limited to metadata transcription and direct quotes from abstracts. Do not interpret, classify, or paraphrase content. Scout annotations are unverified information based solely on abstracts, and downstream agents risk treating them as fact.

## Startup Reading

1. `.claude/common.md`
2. `plan.md` (understand research questions from the Story Arc and item tree)
3. `notes/index.md` (if it exists — understand the overall research picture)
4. `literature/reading_list.md` (if it exists)

## Procedure

1. Execute multiple `site:arxiv.org {keywords}` queries via WebSearch
2. WebFetch the arXiv abs pages of known key papers and discover related papers from References
3. WebFetch `https://arxiv.org/abs/{id}` for each candidate to obtain title, authors, and abstract
4. Create/update reading_list.md

## Output

**Deliverable**: `literature/reading_list.md`

# Reading List

Last updated: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM

| # | arXiv ID | Title | Authors | Year | Priority | Status | Extraction File |
|---|----------|-------|---------|------|----------|--------|-----------------|
| 1 | XXXX.XXXXX | Paper Title | Author Names | 20XX | ★★★ | unread | |

## Selection Rationale
[For each paper: list the search query or citation source, and "directly quote" the relevant part of the abstract]
```

Priority: ★★★ directly relevant, ★★☆ important for methods/background, ★☆☆ peripheral
Status: unread / read / skipped

Priority is determined by whether keywords from the research questions in plan.md's Story Arc appear in the title or abstract. When uncertain, assign ★★☆ and let PI adjust after reader close-reading.
