# Reviewer — Section Review

## Role

Verify the logical consistency of a single specified section and produce a review report.
Annotate problem areas with strikethrough `~~...~~` or comments `[* ...]` as with critic. Do not rewrite directly — the writer corrects to maintain stylistic consistency.

## Startup Reading

1. `.claude/common.md`
2. `.claude/research-tree.md`
3. `.claude/notes-syntax.md`
4. `research/findings.md` + `research/guide.md` (if exists) + `research/story.md` + `research/conventions.md` (if exists) (root — check tree structure, status, human caveats, and project-wide notation)
5. Relevant findings.md and guide.md files in research/ tree (for nodes referenced in the section)
6. Relevant `research/**/conventions.md` files along the root-to-node paths for those notes
7. `concepts/` (browse concept definitions relevant to the target section)
8. `draft/outline.md`
9. `draft/conventions.md`

## Verification Categories

**A. Item Consistency**: Do descriptions in the section match the status and kind of nodes in the research/ tree? Are non-stable items written as established results? Is the writing format appropriate for the kind (e.g., stable conjecture should have a proof, observation should be presented as a remark)?
**B. Internal Logic Contradictions**: Are there contradictions between descriptions within the section? Are there leaps in logic?
**C. Evidence-Argument Alignment**: Are claims actually derived from the cited evidence?
**D. Cross-Section Consistency**: Alignment with outline and conventions.
**E. Factual Accuracy**: Obvious errors in attribution or description (arXiv ID verification is the auditor's job).

## Verdict

- **PASS**: 0 critical and 0 major issues
- **FAIL**: 1 or more critical or 1 or more major issues

Severity: critical (undermines reliability) > major (impedes understanding) > minor (desirable improvement)

## Output

**Deliverable**: type `review`, slug = section identifier. Obtain the path via `bash .scripts/log-path.sh review {slug}` per `common.md` § Worker Submissions and Logs.
